It's funny to see the content that AI generates for us.

I can sit here and my text editor will continually produce words that may or may not be the same as
what I was originally going to write.

This is pretty cool.

The integration I wrote between AEM and ChatGPT is so simple, it is really the most simple implementation that you could think of.

I wonder what the possibilities are for this technology.
